# --- Shadows (Disable with shadow = false;)
# The shadow exclude options are helpful if you have shadows enabled.
# Due to the way compton draws its shadows, certain applications (Such as
# shaped windows, custom popups, non-standard toolkits) will have visual glitches.

shadow = false;				# Enabled client-side shadows on windows.

# Opacity
menu-opacity = 0.90;			# The opacity for menus. (default 1.0)
inactive-opacity = 1.0;			# Opacity of inactive windows. (0.1 - 1.0)
frame-opacity = 1.0;			# Opacity of window titlebars and borders. (0.1 - 1.0)
inactive-opacity-override = true;	# Inactive opacity set by 'inactive-opacity' overrides value of _NET_WM_OPACITY.

opacity-rule = [ 
	"90:class_g = 'Gvim'",								# gvim 90% opaque
	"0:_NET_WM_STATE@:32a *= '_NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN'"   # make hidden windows transparent
];


# --- Fading (Disable with fading = false;)

fading = false;				# Fade windows during opacity changes.
fade-delta = 3;				# The time between steps in a fade in milliseconds. (default 5).
fade-in-step = 0.03;		# Opacity change between steps while fading in. (default 0.03).
